# Scripts for plotting repo behavior

`ts.py` is for plotting the time series
![ts plot](https://github.com/ucsd-cse120-fa16/stats120/blob/master/images/ts.png)

`early_bird.py` plots the correlations between the scores and the starting date.
We can see that students started early tend to have better score
(which is consistent across proj2 and proj3)
